        <h2>Supporting cast</h2>
        <p class="aside">In addition to the core six cast, there was a raft of supporting cast members who added great depth to the show. A few of my favourite supporting cast members include James Michael Tyler as Gunther, Paul Rudd as Mike Hannigan, Maggie Wheeler as Janice Hosenstein and Tom Selleck as Dr. Richard Burke.</p>
        
        <h2>Guest stars</h2>
        <p class="aside">With a total of 10 years on the air and a reputation as one of TV's most-watched sitcoms, Friends racked up an impressive number of high-profile guest stars in its time. But considering that the show aired 236 episodes, itâ€™s hard to remember every celebrity who popped up throughout its 10 seasons. </p>
       
        <p class="aside">Some of the most popular guest stars include Brad Pitt as Will Colbert, Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Sandy, Anna Faris as Erica, Alec Baldwin as Parker, Reese Witherspoon as Jill, Christina Applegate as Amy, Brooke Shields as Erica, Winona Ryder as Melissa and John Stamos as Zack.</p>
